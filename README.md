# BowlSmart - Cricket Biomechanics Analysis Platform

BowlSmart is a modern web application built for automated cricket bowling biomechanics analysis. It utilizes AI/ML models to process video footage, detect bowling phases, analyze player poses, and generate actionable insights for performance improvement and injury prevention.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project is structured into two main components:
- **Backend**: Built with Python and FastAPI. It handles video processing, human pose estimation (using MediaPipe), data storage, and biomechanical analysis algorithms.
- **Frontend**: A sleek, responsive dashboard built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It offers an intuitive UI to upload videos, analyze stats, and view generated reports.

## ⚙️ How to Install and Run Locally

Follow these step-by-step instructions to get both the frontend and backend up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16.14 or later)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.9 or later)
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository
Open a terminal and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <YOUR-GITHUB-REPOSITORY-URL>
cd bowling-biomechanics
```

### 2. Set up the Backend (FastAPI)
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install all the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
   *The backend should now run on `http://localhost:8000`*

### 3. Set up the Frontend (Next.js)
1. Open a **new terminal tab/window** and navigate back to the project root, then into the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd bowling-biomechanics/frontend
   ```
2. Install npm dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`*

### 4. Explore the System
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the BowlSmart dashboard.
- You can access the backend auto-generated API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
